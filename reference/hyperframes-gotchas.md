# HyperFrames gotchas (silent failures)

Each of these cost real debugging. Most never show in `lint`; several only show in the rendered MP4.

## Timeline and seeking

1. **Zero-duration sets at t = 0 revert.** The runtime seeks `t + 0.001` then `t`, so `tl.set(el, ..., 0)`
   rolls back. Put baselines in build-time `gsap.set`.
2. **Delayed `fromTo` leaks at t = 0.** `immediateRender` applies the FROM state on build; a delayed
   `fromTo` whose FROM is visible shows on the first frame. Use `immediateRender: false` on every delayed
   `fromTo`.
3. **Renderers freeze past the last tween.** A per-frame renderer reads `tl.time()`, which clamps at the
   timeline's end; if the timeline is shorter than its slot, the last seconds freeze. Extend every
   timeline to its slot (`tl.to({}, { duration: 0.01 }, DUR - 0.01)`) or give the hold a real tween.
4. **Stale proxies in per-frame drivers.** An `onUpdate` on a clock tween reads proxy objects tweened by
   tweens added after it one render late on a seek. Use one timeline-level dispatcher
   (`hwOnUpdate`, runs after children) and compute values as pure functions of `tl.time()`.
5. **A `tl.set` registered before its target exists** only logs "target not found" and the element never
   shows. Create DOM first, then register tweens.
6. **Duplicate keys in the spine win silently** (see [timing-architecture.md](timing-architecture.md)).

## Visibility and layering

7. **Never set `style.visibility = "visible"`** from scene code: an explicit visible child shows even when
   the framework hides its clip. Use `""` (inherit) for shown; `autoAlpha` is safe (it writes `inherit`).
8. **Parked elements leak.** Elements parked off-frame still paint their shadows (a hard `0 18px 0` shadow
   showed as two bars on the top edge). Park beyond the shadow's extent or hide them (`autoAlpha 0`).
9. **An overlay that replaces text** must hide the replaced text with a zero-duration
   `visibility: hidden` at the same time, or the audit reports an overlap.
10. **Motion-blur copies snapshot computed styles** (registry motion-blur): a copy attached while its clip
    was inactive stays hidden forever; patch it to skip `visibility`; blurred elements must move by
    property tweens (sub-frame seeks suppress `onUpdate`).

## The audit (`hyperframes check`)

11. **It reads clipped content.** Ticker rows parked outside an `overflow: hidden` window, swiped-away
    panels and scrolled-out chat bubbles are measured as if visible: set `visibility: hidden` on what left
    and `inherit` on what arrives.
12. **Contrast samples rendered pixels.** Clipped text over a different background reports 1:1; a dimmed
    background layer reports low contrast even through an overlay. Hide, or accept and justify.
13. **`data-layout-allow-overlap` is not inherited.** Mark every text-bearing element in intentional stacks
    (a helper walks a root and marks elements with direct text nodes); text filled later needs the
    attribute in its template.
14. **Content-area overlaps.** Big display type with a tight line height (condensed display faces have a
    1.4-1.5 em content box) flags overlaps that are not visible: verify on a snapshot, then mark.
15. **Rotated elements and SVG groups:** rotated text grows its bounding box (false overlaps); SVG `<g>`
    rotations need `transformOrigin: "50% 50%"` or the audit flags pivot drift.
16. **`letterSpacing` tweens are a lint error** (non-transform motion); tween `scaleX` instead.

## Rendering and look

17. **Animated film grain explodes bitrate** (15 MB -> 183 MB for 15 s). Hold one static grain tile.
18. **Fine grids at wide zoom shimmer into moiré** and bloat the encode; fade grids with camera scale.
19. **In-plane yaw over a long board swings the far end through the lens.** Keep the product head-on; if
    something rotates, cull by projected Z.
20. **Canvas masks from web fonts** must be rasterized lazily once `document.fonts.check(font)` is true
    (setup runs before fonts load); keep a DOM element using the face so it loads. Static image masks:
    sample offline to base64 (no async load, no taint).
21. **SVG mask reveals with `stroke-linecap: round`** draw a cap disc at the start of a zero-length dash;
    use `butt`.
22. **Pixel colour doubts:** sample the PNG (`crop=1:1,format=rgba` then `od`) before blaming the asset;
    ffmpeg preview overlays mislead.

## Tooling

23. **Studio preview rewrites composition files** (stamps ids, re-serializes attributes). Re-read files
    before editing after a preview, and stop it (`preview --stop`).
24. **`"type": "module"` packages:** `require()` of a browser UMD lib returns an ESM namespace; read
    `globalThis.X` after the require.
25. **No system ffmpeg:** use `ffmpeg-static` and `@ffprobe-installer/ffprobe` as devDependencies (not
    `ffprobe-static`, 335 MB), symlinked into `.bin/` by the CLI wrapper.
26. **Locale:** a comma-decimal shell locale breaks ffmpeg arguments built with `printf`/`awk`;
    `export LC_ALL=C` in every script.
27. **`hyperframes beats` finds nothing in quiet passages.** Build an onset function from ffmpeg band
    envelopes (`astats` RMS every 10 ms over full, low-pass and band-pass) and track beats yourself.
28. **The animation map script needs the producer packages;** install them temporarily with `bun add -d`.
29. **Heavy all-frames analysis** (extracting every frame to images) eats disk and memory on long renders;
    verify with a handful of extracted frames and delete dumps right away.

## Craft traps

30. **Stop-and-go rides smear** (every leg at rest at both ends): use spline keys for rides
    ([stage-3d.md](stage-3d.md)).
31. **A container scaling in shrinks its children**: keep a handed-off element outside the scaling
    container, or delay the handoff until the container is at rest.
32. **A light bubble on a light background vanishes** without its shadow; keep the shadow until the
    receiver's container is in place.
33. **An iris that starts at the frame centre** shows a stray dot for a few frames; start it behind a
    character or an object, or open it while the title lines dive past the viewer (it emerges behind them).
34. **An ask grid that is not a whole number of beats** drifts off the music within two asks.
35. **Text measured with font metrics offline:** static display faces measure fine with a font library;
    variable fonts may crash `getVariation`; estimate heavier weights from the regular advances or
    measure in a snapshot.
36. **`composition_file_too_large`:** lint warns above 300 structural lines per composition (styles do not
    count). Split by layer, not by time: e.g. the 3D world and its screen overlays as sibling compositions
    on the same window; move pure helpers (geometry, formatters) into `assets/lib/`.
37. **Hidden rows still take space:** `autoAlpha: 0` leaves a list's rows in the layout, so a panel that
    should grow with its rows shows up tall and empty. Animate each row's height from 0 (with
    `overflow: hidden`) as it arrives.
38. **An iris tweened as a clip-path string can land off-centre:** `circle(0% at x% y%)` -> `circle(120% at
    x% y%)` drew its centre at the wrong x in a real project. Draw irises per frame in px from the spine
    (`circle(Rpx at Xpx Ypx)` through a cached style writer) and check the centre on a snapshot.
39. **`bun install` fails on the ffmpeg-static download** (HTTP 5xx from its release host): transient. Re-run
    `setup.sh`; it keeps every file it already added and repeats the install.
40. **A scene's static layers show at its window start:** grid lines or axes of the next scene appear over
    the previous one while their windows overlap. Draw them in on the scene's own cue, after the handoff.
41. **A camera push breaks a pixel-identical handoff:** a scene with a slow push scales the rects it hands
    over, so the receiving scene's copy shows doubled edges and labels. Keep handed-over elements out of
    the pushed group, or push both scenes identically.
42. **`loudnorm` falls back to dynamic mode when the peak-to-loudness ratio is too high** (a sting whose
    one low hit is ~14 dB over a quiet bed): linear mode needs `TP_target - I_target` (14.5 dB at -16/-1.5)
    ≥ measured `input_tp - input_i`, otherwise the second pass silently goes dynamic and `aresample` fails
    ("Cannot select channel layout"). Measure the raw mix first; lift the mid/high bed (K-weighting barely
    counts sub energy) or trim the hit until the ratio fits.
43. **opentype.js cannot shape some modern fonts** (`substitutionType ... lookupType: 6 - substFormat: 2 is
    not yet supported` from `ccmp`), so `font.getPath`/`forEachGlyph` throw. For plain Latin wordmarks, lay
    out by hand: `charToGlyph` per character, `advanceWidth + getKerningValue`, `glyph.getPath(x, y, size)`.
